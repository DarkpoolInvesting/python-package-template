```

## üöÄ Features

In this [cookiecutter üç™](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template, we aimed to combine the most state-of-the-art libraries and best development practices for Python.

For your development we've prepared:

- Supports for `Python 3.7` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/setup.cfg).
- Power of [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) formatters.
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with formatters above.
- Type checks with the pre-configured [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io).
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
- Docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint).
- Security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit).
- Well-made [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.editorconfig), [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.dockerignore), and [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.gitignore). You don't have to worry about those things.

For building and deployment:

- `GitHub` integration.
- [`Makefile`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/Makefile#L89) for building routines. Everything is already set up for security checks, codestyle checks, code formatting, testing, linting, docker builds, etc. More details at [Makefile summary](#makefile-usage)).
- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker/Dockerfile) for your package.
- `Github Actions` with predefined [build workflow](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/workflows/build.yml) as the default CI/CD.
- Always up-to-date dependencies with [`@dependabot`](https://dependabot.com/) (You will only [enable it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates)).
- Automatic drafts of new releases with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). It creates a list of changes based on labels in merged `Pull Requests`. You can see labels (aka `categories`) in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/release-drafter.yml). Works perfectly with [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

For creating your open source community:

- Ready-to-use [Pull Requests templates](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and several [Issue templates](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- Files such as: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` are generated automatically.
- [`Stale bot`](https://github.com/apps/stale) that closes abandoned issues after a period of inactivity. (You will only [need to setup free plan](https://github.com/marketplace/stale)). Configuration is [here](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/.stale.yml).
- [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter).

## ü§Ø How to use it

### Installation

Before creating a new project from this template, you need to install the dependency:

```bash
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Go to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:TezRomacH/python-package-template
```

### Input variables

The `cookiecutter generator`  will ask you for some data, you might want to have at hand before generating the project.

The input variables, with their default values (some auto-generated), are:

|     **Parameter**     |      **Default value**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                               |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `project_name`           | `python-project`            | The name of the project. It might be a good idea to  [check the availability of such name](http://ivantomic.com/projects/ospnc/) before creating the project. |
| `project_description`    | based on the `project_name` | Brief description of your project. |
| `organization`           | based on the `project_name` | Name of the organization. This is needed to generate the license file and to specify the ownership of the project in `pyproject.toml`. |
| `license`                | `MIT`                       | Type of license. One of `MIT`, `BSD-3`, `GNU GPL v3.0` and `Apache Software License 2.0`. |
| `minimal_python_version` | `3.7`                       | Minimal Python version for your project. One of `3.7`, `3.8` and `3.9`. Used for builds, GitHub workflow and formatters (`black`, `isort` and `pyupgrade`). |
| `github_name`            | based on the `organization` | GitHub username where the package will be hosted. The cookiecutter will use this name to correctly configure the `README.md`, `pyproject.toml` and template files for GitHub. |
| `email`                  | based on the `organization` | Email is needed for generating the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md` files and to specify the ownership of the project in `pyproject.toml`. |
| `version`                | `0.1.0`                     | An initial version of the package. Make sure it follows the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification. |
| `line_length`             | 88                         | The max length per line (used for autoformatting with `black` and `isort`). NOTE: This value must be between 50 and 300. |

The entered values will be saved in the `cookiecutter-config-file.yml` file so that you won't lose them. üòâ

#### Demo

[![Demo of github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template](https://asciinema.org/a/422052.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/422052)

#### More details

After using this generator, your new project (the directory created) will contain an extensive `README.md` with instructions for development, deployment, etc. You can read [the project `README.md` template](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D) before.

### Initial setting up

#### Initialize `poetry` and `pre-commit`

By running `make install`

After you run the cookiecutter command and the project appears in your directory, the console will display [a message about how to initialize the project](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D#very-first-steps).

#### Package example

All manipulations with dependencies are executed through Poetry. If you're new to it, look through [the documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Notes about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy@latest`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry build`
- etc

</p>
</details>

The template comes with a cute little CLI application example. It uses [`Typer`](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) to CLI and [`Rich`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) for beautiful formatting in the terminal output.

After installation via `make install` (preferred) or `poetry install` you can try to play with the example:

```bash
poetry run <project_name> --help
```

```bash
poetry run <project_name> --name Roman
```

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish üôÇ `poetry publish --build`

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/Makefile) contains many functions for fast assembling and convenient work.

<details>
<summary>1. Download Poetry</summary>
<p>

```bash
make poetry-download
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Check the security of your code</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches a `Poetry` and `Pip` integrity check as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`. By default, the build will not crash if any of the items fail.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Check the codestyle</summary>
<p>

The command is similar to `check-safety` but to check the code style, obviously. It uses `Black`, `Darglint`, `Isort`, and `Mypy` inside.

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Run all the codestyle formaters</summary>
<p>

Ensure you've run `make install` before.

```bash
make codestyle
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Run tests</summary>
<p>

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Run all the linters</summary>
<p>

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Build docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template/tree/master/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker).

Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Or to remove all of this

```bash
make clean-all
```
</p>
</details>
